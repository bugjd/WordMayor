# WordMayor

WordMayor is a swift package that provides the users with a way to Word ChallengeList's which can be used in an fun or educational game such as a Spelling Test or a WordSearch. The Package is designed in a way that people can easily fork it and add their own words into the project. the Project has also been designed to utilise git submodule's for the storage of the word's which come from other repository's.

This project was designed under the MIT License and I have desgined by package to have the concept of 'Repository's'' for each ChallangeList in the package which allows you to quickly provide attribution to the creator of the .txt file your ChallangeList is using.

The Package has been designed to also handle user generated ChallangeLists but dooes not handle the storage of such a list.

## Git Submodules used in the Project
    1. [WordCatalogue](https://github.com/bugjd/WordCatalogue) by [bugjd](https://github.com/bugjd). [Released under the MIT License](https://github.com/bugjd/WordCatalogue/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
    2. [bugjd's fork of](https://github.com/bugjd/wordlists) [imsky/wordlists](https://github.com/imsky/wordlists) by [imsky](https://github.com/imsky)

## Future Plans for WordMayor
    1. Implementing a more efficient way to store the files
    2. All developers to provide their own .txt files without forking the package.
    3. Providing better documentation
